Assignment 1: 
* Demonstrating Central Limit Theorem 
* Generated 100 samples from 5 different distributions 
* Created dictionary to hold the distributions
* Set population mean as 100
* Faced some problems with binomial distribution, set tr as mymean(100) initially, but this skewed the plot, changed tr to 200, and p to 0.5 to center plot around mean 100 
* Create random distributions in a loop
* Plot sample mean against sample size, plots follows the law of large numbers, as the sample size increases, the mean tends towards the mean fixed. 
* Plotted distributions of all sample means. Got a skewed distribution initially when binomial was set to mymeans. Resultingly, gaussian curve is also skewed. Looked normal after updating binomial distribution
* Received help from Alex in plotting distributions for all means, plus elegant way of writing for loops 

Assignment 2: 
* Received help from Unisse in accessing the data, did not create PUIdata folder initially (case sensitive)
* Followed example from citibikes_gender.ipynb by Professor Federica
* Selected categories: subscribers/customers, reassigned 1/0
* Visualised counts of each type of user for each day across the week
* As number of customers are significantly lower than subscribers, data is normalised and plotted 

Assignment 3: 
* Conducted z-test as per Lab3
