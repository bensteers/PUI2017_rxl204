### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**
Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.
Answer:
H0: The average percentage of weight lost by people in the test sample on a diet is less or the same as for the control sample. 
H0: Ptest <= Pcontrol

Ha: The average percentage of weight lost by the sample on exercise is larger or the same as by the sample on a diet alone.
H1: Pt > Pc

**Alternaative Hypothesis**
The difference in body fat percentage is significantly higher when only 1,500 calories are consumed in a day compared to 1-hour of cardio exercise 3 times a week. 

**Null Hypothesis**
The difference in body fat percentage is significantly higher when 1-hour of cardio exercise is done 3 times a week compared to consuming only 1,500 calories in a day.


**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

H0: Mean IQ scores for children whose mothers smoke (10 or more cigarettes a day) during preganancy are the same as mean for those whose mothers do not smoke. 
H1: Mean IQ scores for whose mothers smoke (10 or more cigarettes a day) during pregnancy are significantly lower than the mean for those whose mothers do not smoke. 

**Alternaative Hypothesis**
The average IQ of children whose mother smoke at least 10 cigarettes a day is significantly lower than..

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.
This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
H0: There is no spatial correlation between the prevalence of diabetes and the distribution of food deserts
H1: There is a higher incidence of diabetes in proximity to food deserts
