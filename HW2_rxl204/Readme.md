Readme 

## Part 1  
* Requested for MTA API key
* Accessed real time data for bus 52, familiarised with dataset to extract requried information
* Created a loop for bus count to print out bus locations in the required format

## Part 2
* Referenced aSimplePythonThatWritesToCSV.py from Lab2 to output to a csv file
* Repeated code as in Part 1. Ran code initially without NA condition. Received help from Gaurav to add in if condition for when OnwardCalls field is empty. 

## Part 3
* Used environmental variable DFDATA to get path for data catalog
* Was unable to access catalog online, attempted to access via compute, used path and urban profiler to access dataset
* Used indexing method to select columns instead of using drop method due to large number of columns.
